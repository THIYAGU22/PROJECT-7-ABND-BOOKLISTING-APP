# PROJECT-7-ABND-BOOKLISTING-APP

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Book Listing app which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic. 
I've used the google books api in order to fetch results and display them to the user.

CONCEPTS COVERED:

1.Fetching data from an API

2.Using an AsyncTask

3.Parsing a JSON response

4.Creating a list based on that data and displaying it to the user.
