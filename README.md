# PROJECT-7-ABND-BOOKLISTING-APP

- The goal is to design and create the structure of a Book Listing app which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic. 
- I've used the google books api in order to fetch results and display them to the user.

## CONCEPTS COVERED:

- Fetching data from an API

- Using an AsyncTask

- Parsing a JSON response

- Creating a list based on that data and displaying it to the user.
